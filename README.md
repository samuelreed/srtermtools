# srtermtools

It's a collection of my terminal tools, usually triggered as part of a chain of .*rc files in order to display a few reminders and checks. I also have a unique little tool for my vastly out of date router that does quick resets and port forwarding changes for video games.

* daycounter - gives a console output for the # of days since or before an upcoming event.
* sitecheck - performs quick fuzzy hashes of websites and can check up on the hashes to identify various degrees of bit changes.
* routerrebooter - does quick command line resets and forwarding changes for the <TODO: what is this thing exactly> brand router.
